      <div class="col-md-4"><p> Plutarch records that before Julius Caesar had even landed in Egypt Theodotus, the tutor of 
      Ptolemy XIII, sailed out to meet him with the severed head of Pompey. This was intended to curry favour with Caesar and 
      encourage him to set sail for Rome immediately with his business in Egypt being finished, but it had the opposite effect.
       Caesar was absolutely furious at the cowardly murder of Pompey who was, of course, his son-in-law. It is possible that
        he intended to show mercy to Pompey (as he did to many of his enemies) as Plutarch suggested that he wept openly and 
        then took measures to protect the head until a proper burial could be arranged, however, Dio suggests that Caesar did 
        intend to kill Pompey but was dismayed that it had been undertaken in such a manner and on the orders of a foreigner 
        and perhaps exaggerated his grief for political effect. Either way it hardened his feelings against Ptolemy XIII.
        Cleopatra was determined to make the most of Pothinusâ€™ miscalculation and managed to arrange a secret meeting with 
        Caesar. Plutarch tells the famous tale of how Cleopatra was hidden in a role of carpet (or sleeping bag depending on
         the translation) which was unrolled to reveal her in all her glory. However, it is suggested by some authorities that
          she was in fact simply veiled which is perhaps more likely.
        Whether it was the beauty of Cleopatra, the fact that she was a direct descendant of Alexander the Great, her courage 
        or her charisma which charmed Caesar from this point (or shortly after) they became lovers. Caesar immediately reversed
         the decision of Pompey and reinstated Cleopatra as co-ruler with her brother.</p></div>
